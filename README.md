# nodejs-eventloop

This project is a simple `nodeJS` script, which serves as a nice test for evaluating how well you understand `nodeJS`'s `Event Loop`.

* Examine `index.js` and try to determine the order in which each `console.log` will be printed to the terminal.  

## Solution
1. `Where do I go?`
2. `I read the file after waiting!`
3. `I am a timer!`
4. `I read the file!`
5. `I read the file!`
6. `I read the file!`
7. `I read the file!`

Good Luck!
