\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Prominent Democrats are making waves with tax proposals targeting the wealthiest Americans. And new polls are showing that \'93tax the rich!\'94 is a popular battle cry.\
Elizabeth Warren, the presidential candidate and Democratic senator from Massachusetts, has unveiled a wealth tax for what she\'92s calling \'93ultramillionaires.\'94 It would impose an annual tax of 2 percent on accumulated wealth greater than $50 million, with the tax rate rising to 3 percent for billionaires.

Warren\'92s proposal follows a similar plan backed by Rep.
