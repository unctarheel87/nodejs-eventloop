Prominent Democrats are making waves with tax proposals targeting the wealthiest Americans. And new polls are showing that “tax the rich!” is a popular battle cry.
Elizabeth Warren, the presidential candidate and Democratic senator from Massachusetts, has unveiled a wealth tax for what she’s calling “ultramillionaires.” It would impose an annual tax of 2 percent on accumulated wealth greater than $50 million, with the tax rate rising to 3 percent for billionaires. The tax would raise an estimated $2.75 trillion over a decade to help those Warren calls “yacht-less Americans.”
